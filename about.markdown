  Hi. I'm Kat. Amongst other things, I like to play with code. 

  As did many people at the beginning of the pandemic, I started looking at and writing code for the underlying data.  Frustrated with the aggregated data visualizations that dominated the feeds, eventually I took the opportunity to use the data and learn GIS programming in Python. (R is also on my to-do list, but Python had a lower entry point due to some nice packages I already knew about.) 

  And this was born this repository.  It contains mostly GIS images of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries (when available). It is focused mainly on the United States, although, I have the underlying code to create both global and more granular maps.

  The code I used to create the images is in a currently private repository. I'm lucky enough 
  to work from home during this crisis, and so this work is done on the weekend. Eventually, the 
  code repository will be in a state that I'm okay sharing it. If you're interested in the 
  underlying code, let me know by [opening an issue (best)](https://github.com/kekoziar/covid19-images/issues), or contact me via social media/email (can't guarantee I'll see it in a timely manner), and I'll prioritize sharing it.
