# COVID-19 Images
This repository contains mostly GIS images of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries (when 
available). It is focused mainly on the United States, although, I have the underlying code to 
create both global and more granular maps.

The code I used to create the images is in a currently private repository. I'm lucky enough to 
work from home during this crisis, and so this work is done on the weekend. Eventually, the code
repository will be in a state that I'm okay sharing it. If you're interested in the underlying
code, let me know by opening an issue, and I'll prioritize sharing it.

Please cite the images when used.
