Welcome to my first post in the redesigned site. I have four weeks worth of GIS images, which you can find in the [depths of the repository](https://github.com/kekoziar/covid19-images/tree/master/images/gifs).

The frustrating and scary thing I've noticed in the COVID-19 images over the past few weeks is the prevalence of red circles (deaths) showing up *out of nowhere*, with no or little orange circle (cases). This is a result of the lack of testing, which means we don't know the true impact and can't track the vectors (contact tracing) of the virus.
