This week's timelapse gifs are at the bottom.  As always, you can find gifs from previous weeks in the [depths of the repository](https://github.com/kekoziar/covid19-images/tree/master/images/gifs). 

Because the gifs are too fast for in-depth examination, I want to focus on the difference between last and this week through the jpgs.  Here are the two images overlayed, so you can compare them using a slider.

It's fairly obvious that the number of cases is increasing.  The next slider image compares the total number of cases, instead of per 100k.

But, as you can see from the timelapses, we haven't had any week without new COVID-19 cases. Nor, did we have any two consecutive weeks which showed a significant drop in new cases, except areas which experienced a true crisis (New York, New Jersey, etc). In essense, we didn't experience a wave, we plateaued just below the peak.  Stay safe. Keep others safe.  Pretend you might be sick but don't know it, and wear a mask so you don't infect others. Don't be the asshole who hides their zombie bite.
