#### COVID-19 Data
- JHU CSSE [git repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19){:target="_blank"}, Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering: Center for Systems Science and Engineering
- [California Department of Public Health dashboard](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/nCOV2019.aspx){:target="_blank"}. I used the "Racial Demographics" page to scrape data.  Their data is not in a downloadable format.

#### GIS and Related Data
- US Census, [Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html){:target="_blank"} for County shapefiles
- ArcGIS, [UIA World Countries Boundaries](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/UIA::uia-world-countries-boundaries) for Country shapefiles
- CIA [World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-d.html), for Country Codes and Country Populations

#### Where to find more COVID-19 data

I'm keeping a longer annotated list of COVID-19 data and visualization sources at my university library's [COVID-19 LibGuide](https://guides.lib.ucr.edu/c.php?g=1008585&p=7563992){:target="_blank"}.
